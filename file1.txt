lots of people buy it every year regardless. how much did you people expect from a demo anyway? most game demos have an hour or two of content and then you move on

40$ is the standard virtual ticket price, an extra 10 for the demo isnt bad

to put it another way, no one should have paid 50$ just for a freaking demo, hell overwatch in its entirety only cost 40
